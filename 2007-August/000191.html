&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> look? 
</I>
i like the gist of the design although some
aspects (glass effect, curve proportions) could
do with changing (imho). the thing is, i'm not
sure it's ideal as a fixed native default as it
won't sit well with the majority of themes.
(as it's 2D and features large curves)

having said that, i'm unlikely to use the
fanslider so i'm not going to bitch about what it
looks like (any more :).

more importantly for me, the the fan is unusably
slow on both my systems. hopefully i can catch
you on irc at some point and we can compare and
contrast X configurations.

there's also no fallback for non composite
systems. (or where composite is enabled but
there's no composite manager running) we
need that i think.

&gt;<i> I'll fix the glass effect to be a better
</I>&gt;<i> 3d effect soon. How is other code progressing?
</I>&gt;<i> Torben, what are you doing with lv2 stuff? Get
</I>&gt;<i> it into svn one way or another. We could also
</I>&gt;<i> use some example code for the midi/osc/etc
</I>&gt;<i> control stuff you mentioned. We seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> getting quite a collection of new features so
</I>&gt;<i> maybe we should put out a release soon. Probaby
</I>&gt;<i> when the lv2 and meter stuff is finalised? What
</I>&gt;<i> else is required?
</I>
i'm in no rush for a release. i don't know how far
along the lv2 stuff or meters are but we are
halfway though reorganising the range widgets.
it's coming together but it's still a mess at the 
moment. if you want to release reasonably soon
then i'll postpone any more ambitious changes and
concentrate on sorting out what we have so far.

it makes sense to me. the widgets should only interact with the
mapper or it's derived values. some widgets may need to 
access the real value for display purposes but i don't see that
being a problem. 

&gt;<i> i have major problem with lacking ui user use cases and specification

</I>


&gt;<i> Some code i saw in phatknob is obviously

which parts?

&gt;<i> some is commented out and i cannot fix things without knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> how it should work. 
</I>
can't help if we don't know which parts. the list is
the best way to resolve these issues.

&gt;<i> i know this is work in progress but we should at
</I>&gt;<i> least document what are our goals. i think we should put this info in
</I>&gt;<i> the wiki associated with phat project.
</I>
this doesn't really work with our current modus operandi. 

you can't document something until you have decided 
what form it will take. if you need the goals before you
write the code then you have to plan in advance. the 
problem is, we haven't been doing that. 
instead, what we do is closer to rapid prototyping. we
propose solutions to problems as they arise, implement
them, check the implementation for suitability and go
from there.

this piecemeal approach my appear chaotic and inelegant but
it best suits the limited and intermittent resources we 
have at our disposal.

it allows us to move phat forward in short jumps and 
starts rather than an inexorable and orchestrated advance.
anything that demands an extended commitment is bound 
to fail because phat is an ancillary project that competes
for time with primary projects, not to mention all that
tedious real life stuff.

&gt;<i>  i talked with thorwil about knobs
</I>&gt;<i> in particular and i saw his try for this in his blog too and he said
</I>&gt;<i> we have serious discrepancies about knobs ui user use. we should
</I>&gt;<i> document them and take a plan to handle them. 
</I>
i think this is already resolved (in as much as it can be)
the configurable input mapping should allow people to choose 
their preferred method. this is a deal breaker for me so 
if it's not resolved then we have problems. if you have 
more to add then we should run it past loki again.

&gt;<i> as for developer use of
</I>&gt;<i> widgets we lack documentation too and this is serious obstacle when
</I>&gt;<i> changing code (we dont want to strip existing phat-iazed projects,
</I>&gt;<i> right?). we should have use cases (developer point of view) and list of
</I>&gt;<i> projects using phat so they can be checked for compatibility issues
</I>&gt;<i> until project gets stable and coherent enough for other/new projects to
</I>&gt;<i> stay in line with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So let start the list, and move it to wiki later:
</I>&gt;<i>  * zynjacku (through python bindings)
</I>&gt;<i>  * specimen
</I>&gt;<i>  * khagan (through python bindings)
</I>&gt;<i>  * jack_mixer (through python bindings)
</I>&gt;<i>  * demo programs budnled with phat
</I>
we pretty much decided to ignore this issue for now.

as legacies go, we don't have one. the only client
application that is not owned by a phat developer is
specimen. to complete the roster, i offered to keep
specimen in sync with changes to phat.

i've been working under the assumption that we can do
what the hell we like up until the next release. 
at that point, the new features stand a good chance
of attracting new users and building a genuinely
unmanageable legacy.

it's one of them there windows of opportunity.

i don't envisage any changes that will damage the viability of
phat as a solution for any of it's client applications.
a knob will still be a knob, a slider a slider etc. it will
just be a case of updating the client applications to
suit any changes.


&gt;<i> I've made some analysis of developer use cases and come to some
</I>&gt;<i> specification:
</I>&gt;<i>  * simplest use, no gtkadjustments, through accessing widget methods
</I>&gt;<i>    signals directly. i.e. knob_get_value(), connect to knob
</I>&gt;<i>    value-changed signal.
</I>&gt;<i>  * gtkadjustments for more advanced use with two subcases:
</I>&gt;<i>   * supply existing external gtkadjustment
</I>&gt;<i>   * expose our internal gtkadjustment for use somewhere else
</I>
if you have the time and motivation to draw up use cases
then all the better.

&gt;<i> In past I fixed some bugs that were some features not working in all use
</I>&gt;<i> cases. I beleive defining them will improve our code base in future and
</I>&gt;<i> will help testing too.
</I>
no complaints :)

&gt;<i> Now how this interacts with phatrange? In my vision so far direct access
</I>&gt;<i> methods should be implemented as proxy code to phatrange and not
</I>&gt;<i> directly interacting with widget code and thus it may be possible to use
</I>&gt;<i> some hairy macro to define them in all widgets. we need this because
</I>&gt;<i> gobject model does not support method inheritance, or i am wrong?
</I>
i'm not sure. we can chain up to access virtual parent
functions?. (cast the object to it's parent type)

&gt;<i> All gtkadjustment-less methods are implemented in phatrange by operating
</I>&gt;<i> on gtkadjustment referenced in it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still thinking about what is best way for interoperation between
</I>&gt;<i> gtkadjustment and mapper object. in particular, mapper, at least one i
</I>&gt;<i> have currently (monothonic linear spline), has valid range and is
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat incompatible with change of it, caused by external
</I>&gt;<i> gtkadjustment. Do you think we need to support external gtkadjustments
</I>&gt;<i> when we have mapper? I'd say no. Logarithm also has input restritions
</I>&gt;<i> too, thus rendering -50..0 gtkadjustment unusable. At least directly,
</I>&gt;<i> but i think mapper should operate on real range not artificial one, like
</I>&gt;<i> (0..1).
</I>
are there any cases where we cannot detect and translate 
problematic ranges? if there are or the detection and 
translation is too expensive then we are a bit screwed.

&gt;<i> After more inspection of phatknob and those concept discrepancies we
</I>&gt;<i> have, i now beleive we should come with configuration system in next
</I>&gt;<i> release. I propose (and have motivation to work on) class code
</I>&gt;<i> interacting with gconf. In particular I want to start with radial/linear
</I>&gt;<i> knob behaviour, always with left mouse button.
</I>
this should be configurable. it's the only way we can accommodate 
different user and developer preferences. (IOW, it's the only
way we can prevent me and thorsten from killing each other :P )

i'd like to see targets (linear control, absolute control, menu popup
etc) be mappable to input combinations (buttons 1 - 5, and modifiers)

&gt;<i> More configuration
</I>&gt;<i> candidates are welcome. Lets collect them in this thread, I'll put them
</I>&gt;<i> on wiki once we have plan.
</I>
cool.


sorry for the late reply. bit busy atm and every time i tried to 
reply, i ended up writing war and peace.
gotta work on my terseness
:<i>/
</I>
cheers,
pete.

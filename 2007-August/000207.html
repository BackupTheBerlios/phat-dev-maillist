alternative (linear?) adjsutment with mouse button 3
I've not investigated further but it does not work here.

&gt;&gt;<i>  i talked with thorwil about knobs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in particular and i saw his try for this in his blog too and he said
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we have serious discrepancies about knobs ui user use. we should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document them and take a plan to handle them. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i think this is already resolved (in as much as it can be)
</I>&gt;<i> the configurable input mapping should allow people to choose 
</I>&gt;<i> their preferred method. this is a deal breaker for me so 
</I>&gt;<i> if it's not resolved then we have problems. if you have 
</I>&gt;<i> more to add then we should run it past loki again.
</I>
allow people to choose - i agree (see below), but the point is that we
need behaviours to choose from defined. Do you agree with definitions
posted in thorwil blog? Or we have them documented elsewere?

&gt;&gt;<i> Now how this interacts with phatrange? In my vision so far direct access
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> methods should be implemented as proxy code to phatrange and not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly interacting with widget code and thus it may be possible to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some hairy macro to define them in all widgets. we need this because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gobject model does not support method inheritance, or i am wrong?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i'm not sure. we can chain up to access virtual parent
</I>&gt;<i> functions?. (cast the object to it's parent type)
</I>
so this needs more investigation, i'm concerned for pyphat in particular

&gt;&gt;<i> All gtkadjustment-less methods are implemented in phatrange by operating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on gtkadjustment referenced in it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm still thinking about what is best way for interoperation between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gtkadjustment and mapper object. in particular, mapper, at least one i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have currently (monothonic linear spline), has valid range and is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhat incompatible with change of it, caused by external
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gtkadjustment. Do you think we need to support external gtkadjustments
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when we have mapper? I'd say no. Logarithm also has input restritions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too, thus rendering -50..0 gtkadjustment unusable. At least directly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but i think mapper should operate on real range not artificial one, like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (0..1).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> are there any cases where we cannot detect and translate 
</I>&gt;<i> problematic ranges? if there are or the detection and 
</I>&gt;<i> translation is too expensive then we are a bit screwed.
</I>
We can detect but i doubt we can translate. So we can reject external
adjustment if it does not apply, but then, why someone would want
external adjustment at all?

&gt;&gt;<i> After more inspection of phatknob and those concept discrepancies we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have, i now beleive we should come with configuration system in next
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release. I propose (and have motivation to work on) class code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interacting with gconf. In particular I want to start with radial/linear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knob behaviour, always with left mouse button.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this should be configurable. it's the only way we can accommodate 
</I>&gt;<i> different user and developer preferences. (IOW, it's the only
</I>&gt;<i> way we can prevent me and thorsten from killing each other :P )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i'd like to see targets (linear control, absolute control, menu popup
</I>&gt;<i> etc) be mappable to input combinations (buttons 1 - 5, and modifiers)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> More configuration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> candidates are welcome. Lets collect them in this thread, I'll put them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on wiki once we have plan.
</I>
I think we should have manual value input configurable too:

So far list of things that need to be configurable are:
 * context menu popup
 * linear control
 * radial control
 * absolute control
 * manual input (edit box to entr value with keyboard)

each mappable to mouse buttons 1-5 with modifiers (including double
click as option). mappings are optional i.e. if not configured they
are not available.

Mappings should be overridable by program (developer) using the widget.

I'm somewhat sceptical someone will want more than one method of mouse
control active. So maybe it is better to have mouse drag mappable to
button and have mouse drag behaviour as additional property.

<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>we decided to incorporate the useful parts of
gtkrange as phatrange in order to use that as the
base class for our range widgets.
to that end, i've just committed the stripped down
phatrange and some tweaks to phatknob.

in the end i practically gutted phatrange. this
included removing some features that were
ostensibly useful. this is because non of our
widgets would use those features even though the
related properties were inherited. i hope to
put some or all of them back, but rewritten to
better suit our needs, then i'll update the rest
of the range widgets to use them.

these include:

the update policy
	perhaps not so useful for audio but
	probably nice to have anyway

inverted mode
	could this go in the mapper? do we care
	about inverted mode at all?

input handling (scrolling, keys etc)
	this needs some careful thought. we
	either need to leverage gtk features
	to store input configurations or come
	up with our own config system. 
	i don't imagine this will go back in the
	range widget directly either.

so, phatrange now contains little more than the
following:

adjustment handling
a placeholder for the value mapper
some cases to deal with using the parent window
for drawing and a dedicated event window.

unless anyone has any objections, i'll start
moving all range widgets over to phatrange.
this will involve removing log mode until the
mapper is finished.

pete.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; input handling (scrolling, keys etc)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 	to store input configurations or come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 	up with our own config system. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 	i don't imagine this will go back in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the range widget directly either.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO phat config system would be good thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I'd postpone this for release following

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yeah, we lose nothing by doing so as those
</I>&gt;<i> widgets that already have extended input support,
</I>&gt;<i> do so in their own classes.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; so, phatrange now contains little more than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; adjustment handling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a placeholder for the value mapper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; some cases to deal with using the parent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; window for drawing and a dedicated event
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; window.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll check the code in my first time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> window :) ... and try to do something about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these mapper objects
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> feel free to change phatrange to suit. i just
</I>&gt;<i> threw the placeholder in whilst i was there.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; unless anyone has any objections, i'll start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; moving all range widgets over to phatrange.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; this will involve removing log mode until the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; mapper is finished.
</I>

i've commited some work on phatrange and phatknob. in particular i
changed code in phatknob that directly used adjustment with code that
deals with abstracted &quot;adjustment&quot; with 0..1 range. I'd be glad if
someone reviews my changes before i make more, just to ensure i'm not
out of touch.

i have major problem with lacking ui user use cases and specification
how things (should) work. Some code i saw in phatknob is obviously
broken, some is commented out and i cannot fix things without knowledge
how it should work. i know this is work in progress but we should at
least document what are our goals. i think we should put this info in
the wiki associated with phat project. i talked with thorwil about knobs
in particular and i saw his try for this in his blog too and he said
we have serious discrepancies about knobs ui user use. we should
document them and take a plan to handle them. as for developer use of
widgets we lack documentation too and this is serious obstacle when
changing code (we dont want to strip existing phat-iazed projects,
right?). we should have use cases (developer point of view) and list of
projects using phat so they can be checked for compatibility issues
until project gets stable and coherent enough for other/new projects to
stay in line with.

So let start the list, and move it to wiki later:
 * zynjacku (through python bindings)
 * specimen
 * khagan (through python bindings)
 * jack_mixer (through python bindings)
 * demo programs budnled with phat

I've made some analysis of developer use cases and come to some
specification:
 * simplest use, no gtkadjustments, through accessing widget methods
   signals directly. i.e. knob_get_value(), connect to knob
   value-changed signal.
 * gtkadjustments for more advanced use with two subcases:
  * supply existing external gtkadjustment
  * expose our internal gtkadjustment for use somewhere else

In past I fixed some bugs that were some features not working in all use
cases. I beleive defining them will improve our code base in future and
will help testing too.

Now how this interacts with phatrange? In my vision so far direct access
methods should be implemented as proxy code to phatrange and not
directly interacting with widget code and thus it may be possible to use
some hairy macro to define them in all widgets. we need this because
gobject model does not support method inheritance, or i am wrong?

All gtkadjustment-less methods are implemented in phatrange by operating
on gtkadjustment referenced in it.

I'm still thinking about what is best way for interoperation between
gtkadjustment and mapper object. in particular, mapper, at least one i
have currently (monothonic linear spline), has valid range and is
somewhat incompatible with change of it, caused by external
gtkadjustment. Do you think we need to support external gtkadjustments
when we have mapper? I'd say no. Logarithm also has input restritions
too, thus rendering -50..0 gtkadjustment unusable. At least directly,
but i think mapper should operate on real range not artificial one, like
(0..1).

After more inspection of phatknob and those concept discrepancies we
have, i now beleive we should come with configuration system in next
release. I propose (and have motivation to work on) class code
interacting with gconf. In particular I want to start with radial/linear
knob behaviour, always with left mouse button. More configuration
candidates are welcome. Lets collect them in this thread, I'll put them
on wiki once we have plan.

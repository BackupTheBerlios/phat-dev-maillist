</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My 2 cents ;-)

i checked out glade 3.4.3 (now in it's second stable
cycle) and the phat glade plugin builds against that.
some of the widgets crash in the editor when used and the icons
need updating to reflect the new dir scheme.
in fact, i updated the icons last night only to 
have my laptop melt before i could find my
password and check in the changes. which was just great.

anyway, the glade stuff won't take much work to
bring it up to speed. the bugs triggered by
usage in the glade editor are likely widget
bugs anyway.

i can't quite remember what state we left phatrange
in so i'd have to look at that. everyone drifted
away at some point so we don't have nedko's 
value mapper yet either, although that's not a showstopper.

as usual, i'm not convinced that a release now is
worth much, especially if we have to remove or disable work in
progress in order to have a project sane enough for
public consumption. still, i'm not really into
the release early release often paradigm. so, if you
do want to release, sup to ye and i won't object.

as for composite rendering, remember that even when the
prerequisites are met, performance can still
be awful. indeed, this is the case with both my recently
deceased laptop and my main system. no clue why
this would be unless composite benefits from
some accelerated hardware features that are not
present in slightly older cards.

so, in addition to compile time detection (if any is 
needed, i've not looked at the code yet) we could
check for an environmental variable (say PHAT_USE_COMPOSITE)
and enable that code path in lieu of full run time detection
and some kind of phat settings system.
gnome did something similar in the early days of Xft
(AA text).

that way, early adopters can still benefit from or at 
least help bug fix the accelerated widget stuff, but
us proles with our steam driven abacuses won't
be adversely affected =)

i should warn you though, and this may be true of
some of the other developers, when progress on phat
tailed off, i moved on to other things and the project
that was the genesis of my involvement in phat has been
mothballed. i'm still interested in phat but i
haven't got much time to spend on it :/

so anyway, looks like we need to:

fix fan slider control instability

update glade plugin for glade 3.4.*

finish or remove/revert phatrange and it's usage.

identify and fix other widget bugs (may be glade
 related but i doubt it)

add compile time composite detection and env var toggle.
run time detection would be nice too but it should defer
to the env var for now imho.


i would also add:

decide on the best package layout scheme. 

i'll start a new thread about that though.

cheers,
pete.

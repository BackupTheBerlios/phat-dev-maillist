mmm, sorry about the slow response on this, i haven't had a look at
phat for a while. I'm pretty certain zynjacku requires a svn version
of phat. That error suggests the header that pyphat is built against
is too old. Have you done make install on phat before building pyphat?
 I'll have a look when i get near my machine. I've forward this on to
the list in case anyone can fix your prob faster.

<PRE>i've implemented skeleton glade support. the catalog
covers all the existing widgets, icons are in place and
installed but they are all copies of the gtkwindow
pixmap. (this will make it easy to fix them, just grab
one, edit it and commit the changes) 

&quot;./configure --enable-glade-plugin&quot; will build it and it's
disabled by default.

i've setup a support code module 
(phat/glade-plugin/glade-phat.{c,h}) that is built,
installed and works to a degree, but literally has nothing
in it yet. it just serves to hook in the phat lib for glade
until we add some glade support code for any widgets
that require it.

the build options may need tweaking along the way 
but otherwise, adding support code should be as simple
as editing that module. (see the glade 3 source and api
docs for examples)

as expected, not all phat widgets work or work properly
with glade yet and i / we will have to bring them inline
with glade's expectations. 

i'm doing this first rather than importing the cairo knob
for two reasons. firstly, we'd do well to start from
widgets that work properly in glade and secondly, because
we now have 3 quite different pixmap knobs
(phat's, mine and torben's) and a cairo knob that
requires a base class that breaks both the phat knob
and torben's knob. 

so we need to decide what to put in and then all work from
there. 

in particular this means deciding on whether to use
an abstract knob class and derive the vector
and pixmap knobs from that, or have the vector knob
as the bass class and derive the pixmap knob from that..
etc etc to infinity and beyond.

loki, unless you have any objections, i'll check in the
changes to trunk. a patch is attached if you want to look
over it first. (no pixmaps (binaries))

cheers,
pete.

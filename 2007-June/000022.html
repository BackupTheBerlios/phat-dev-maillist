kinda sorta. the knobs we are dealing with have a circular gauge
around them. this normally starts on the left and tracks the knob
clockwise around to the right.
it can also start in the centre (0 degrees) and track left or right.
because you either need a different animation or a different drawing
algorithm to represent the second method you need to be able to
select it somehow. because you can have detents in both methods,
detents alone are not enough.

you could try and derive the type from the adjustment values.
say, if (upper + lower) == 0 then use pan style. but there may be
some cases where this is inappropriate.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
there are any number of possible combinations of dentent count, 
tick count and gauge start position. but in the interests of sanity
i think we should equate detents with ticks then have options to:

 set num ticks  (got this in the cairo knob already)

 draw ticks       (whether to draw the ticks)

 snap to ticks

 set the snap tolerance (proportional to the tick interval)

 toggle between proportional and balance views
 (for knobs without a circular gauge, it's irrelevant)


with sensible defaults, people can ignore what they don't need.

&gt;<i> If this detent_zone value exceeded the degrees of the space between 
</I>&gt;<i> detents, then you'd have a knob which ONLY snapped to detents (again, 
</I>&gt;<i> like a waveform selector).
</I>
ftr, you can do this now by setting the step_increment to (range /
ticks)
which is a cogent reminder that the knob and the adjustment could
well end up in conflict. i'm not sure what to say about that.  

well, except for..
 AIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!

we could subclass GtkAdjustment and put the detents and tolerences in
there and so
resolve all the logic on one place. we'd have detents and tolerences for
free in other
adjustment based widgets then. if someone goes on to point out how
stupid this idea
is, i'll pretend it was an unresearched and off the cuff remark. 

cheers,
pete

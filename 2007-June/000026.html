<PRE>
I've just tried some of the demos and here's some initial thoughts:

 o PhatFanSlider flickers horribly and isn't that easy to use.
   (The demo is a bit odd as well since the range bar is so long
   you don't really need a fan slider for it.)

   When space is really tight I think I prefer the sliders in Cubase
   that popup a large slider widget when you click on them.

 o What is PhatPad supposed to be? I don't think it is working for me.
   All I get is a black rectangle and a bunch of vertical lines.
   Do you need a special input device to try it?

 o Ideas for new widgets (from a quick look at Reason) -
    o Small buttons for things like [M] [S] [&gt;] [SELECT]
      - toggle buttons or radio buttons.
    o LED toggle buttons
    o Level meters
    o 2-way/3-way/n-way switches (horizontal or vertical)
    o Pitch bend/modulation wheel 
    o Maybe prettier spinbutton widgets that look like LCD displays.


I think a reasonable goal for Phat would be to reproduce an interface
like Reason. It wouldn't have to be pixel-perfect, but should have all
the same elements in the same positions and look as nice.

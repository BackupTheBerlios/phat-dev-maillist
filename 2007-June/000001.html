<PRE>ok, here's a quick overview of my current concerns.

i need more widgets than are available in either gtk or phat. i would
also like some additional features added to existing widgets. 

for starters, i'm currently looking at merging my cairo knob into phat.
i'll put this into a branch for now (i'll make some noise when it's
in). 
as my knob is based on an abstract knob class i think it would be a good
idea to break out the existing phat pixmap knob code to make both that
and the new cairo knob inherit from the same abstract class. (both knobs
are derived from torben hohn's galan knob so it shouldn't be too much
hassle)

Uli, i saw on the lad list that you have also done some work on a cairo
knob so perhaps we (and indeed anyone else) can compare notes. i'll
detail the cairo knob and any potential problems in a dedicated post.
(hopefully in a few minutes time)

i also want linear and absolute (radial) knob control modes to be
available and i think it would be best to implement some kind of
configurable mapping between input events and control-update functions
via the gobject properties.

lastly, i've already implemented glade-3 support locally for some things
and as it's nice to test widgets, makes it easy for people to use phat
and is generally easy to do, i'll be looking to add glade-3 support
across phat. (optional and
in it's own subtree) 

if anyone has general issues or comments WRT any of this or if you have
your own list of important changes you'd like to see (or intend to
implement) then tack them on this thread.
it'll help bring me up to speed if nothing else.

thanks for setting up the list loki :)

cheers,
pete.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i like glade and would cheerfully be proven wrong.

</I>&gt;<i> well... we need a Container (derived from GtkLayout) with some glade support. 
</I>
i think i need to sit down and work out if what i need is the same as
what
&quot;we&quot; need. i'll shut up about it until then. :)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; i am making (slow) progress on this. I started porting the GtkKnob from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; gAlan to gob. (it already compiles) need a test harness, to see whether
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the port works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i used glade 3 for this. the knob widget doesn't really need support code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (or not much of it) so it was just a matter of writing a catalog file and dropping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the lib with the knob in it into the glade 3 modules dir.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> could you point me to that code please ?
</I>&gt;<i> or merely the Makefile ;)
</I>

this was my law.xml catalog featuring the vector knob alone:

(cut from here)

&lt;glade-catalog name=&quot;law&quot; library=&quot;law&quot;&gt;

  &lt;glade-widget-classes&gt;

    &lt;glade-widget-class name=&quot;LawKnobVector&quot;
generic-name=&quot;lawknobvector&quot;title=&quot;vectorknob&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/glade-widget-classes&gt;
  &lt;glade-widget-group name=&quot;law-widgets&quot; title=&quot;Law widgets&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;glade-widget-class-ref name=&quot;LawKnobVector&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/glade-widget-group&gt;
&lt;/glade-catalog&gt;

(end)


law.xml was copied to $prefix/share/glade3/catalogs/

the widget icon filename is derived from &quot;generic-name&quot; so i copied
existing window.png to lawknobvector.png in both 16x16/ and 22x22/
subdirs of $prefix/share/glade3/pixmaps/
(because i was too lazy to make my own icon at the time.)

the library is only searched for in the module dir (subject to change in
future)
and the so name is derived from &quot;library&quot; above. so i renamed the lib
liblaw.so
and copied it into the $prefix/lib/glade3/modules/

run glade3.. and it will EXPLODE!!! ..or not, hopefully :)

this: <A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org/docs/index.html">http://glade.gnome.org/docs/index.html</A> and google helped.
also the guys in #glade3 on irc.gimp.net proved to be very friendly and 
helpful when i had questions about minimal requirements for the module
too.

it should be noted that i won't be copying or linking the phat so
directly in
this way. i just did that for testing because it works and requires no
changes to the lib what so ever. 
at some point it will be necessary to add support code and this will go
into the phat-glade so, be linked to phat and itself copied into the
glade modules dir
instead. this keeps them totally separate.

&gt;<i> thats why i want the animation_filename to be a property...
</I>
yeah, the above example is a native knob with no animation. still, we
aim
to provide a standard animation object, an animation store where
animations are loaded then referenced by string name and defaults
that can be referenced by string and are auto loaded on demand. 
in this way you could either have a default animation string or specify
a file name and the property handler would select it accordingly. 

if we forbid G_DIR_SEPARATOR and &quot;.&quot; from appearing in string names
then the same functions can resolve whether an animation object name
or filename is supplied and act accordingly.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> (hopefully in a few minutes time)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i also want linear and absolute (radial) knob control modes to be

</I>&gt;<i> configurable mapping between input events and control-update functions

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> lastly, i've already implemented glade-3 support locally for some things
</I>&gt;<i> and as it's nice to test widgets, makes it easy for people to use phat
</I>&gt;<i> and is generally easy to do, i'll be looking to add glade-3 support
</I>&gt;<i> across phat. (optional and
</I>&gt;<i> in it's own subtree)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if anyone has general issues or comments WRT any of this or if you have

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for setting up the list loki :)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> pete.

minor bugger up with setting it up though.. Just fixed the reply to
stuff... Dodgy defaults... ;)

All the ideas in this sound pretty good to me. The configurable
mapping between input events and control-update functions should
probably been most of the other widgets too. At least I can see it
being useful for the 2d pad to implement a hockey puck style physics
thing. Always though that was cool since i saw it in Lemur.

Metering is still the thing that I'd like to have in phat. Porting all
the meterbridge widgets to phat would really improve all the crappy
vu's everyone is using in there apps now. Also an adsr widget would be
nice and pretty easy. There are a bunch of other ones we already have
a few designs for which would be nice too, like the oscillator
selector (pie menu) widget.  Do we want to make a todo / wishlist on a
wiki?

</I>&gt;<i> Aye. the less duplication the better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metering is still the thing that I'd like to have in phat. Porting all

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> still, i'll take a look. i'll have a peek at what ardour does there too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I  chatted to Steve about this on #lad a while ago. IIRC he said it
was just the state of gtk etc at the time. SDL was just a little
easier for pretty stuff. I think with cairo etc it's probably
different now.



&gt;<i> &gt;  Also an adsr widget would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nice and pretty easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> seconded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are a bunch of other ones we already have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a few designs for which would be nice too, like the oscillator
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; selector (pie menu) widget.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it's a bit specialised. how about as the default presentation for a
</I>&gt;<i> general waveform selector. the options (popup list, no popup or
</I>&gt;<i> pie chart) being gobject properties?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, using the animation store idea you mentioned in the other idea.
The app can request a list with a saw, square, sine, etc by a string
name. There can be a standard set that we ship and the app can provide
others if it wants. This could be related to the gtk iconFactory thing
but i haven't really looked at it. Generic waveform selector with a
range of styles sounds good though.

&gt;<i> &gt;   Do we want to make a todo / wishlist on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wiki?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> great idea. it'd be nice if we could have a section per proposed (or
</I>&gt;<i> existing) widget with suggestions. eg: should it be a linear adsr only?
</I>&gt;<i> or part of a dynamic envelope widget.
</I>&gt;<i> if we do set up a wiki, i'd still encourage people to post to the list
</I>&gt;<i> when they make significant edits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I've set up the basic wishlist/todo wiki. I'd prefer if discussion was
on the list though.

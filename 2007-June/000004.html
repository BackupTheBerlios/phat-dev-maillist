<PRE>as i said in a previous post, i'll be adding a cairo knob to a branch in
phat soon. 

first up though..

Naming policy problems:
----------------------

initially i intended to write my own widget library called liblaw and so
the knob base class was called LawKnob and then i called the
instantiatable classes LawKnobPixmap and LawKnobVector to keep them
alphabetically aligned. 
there are two problems with continuing that naming convention:

1. it's ugly as hell and vector isn't exactly unambiguous

2. phat has a pre-existing instantiatable class called PhatKnob and api
   functions derive their prefix from that (phat_knob_new() for example)
while conversely the phat slider abstract class is named PhatFanSlider
with PhatVFanSlider and PhatHFanSlider being instantiatable.

so as i see it we have 3 choices:

1. name the base knob class PhatKnob and collide with (break) the old
api.	 

2. enjoy our inconsistent naming policy every day and in every way by
adding a post fix. something like PhatKnobBase or PhatKnobCommon. which
gives us the following:

base class              | example instantiatable class
---------------------------------------------------------------------
PhatFanSlider          |     PhatVFanSlider
PhatKnobCommon   |    PhatKnob

yummy. 

3. call the base class something else. like PhatDial or something.
PhatPot anyone? :D

does anyone have a better idea, or a prefered choice?

also, what's the best way to name the pixel and vector knobs to
illustrate their uses and differentiate them?

if nobody cares i'll just choose 3 and go with PhatDial.


Log mode:
----------

i haven't done this yet but i can use loki's code so thats no problem.
in much the same way, where the phat knob has additional features,
i'll add them in to the cairo knob along the way.


Knob Design:
-----------

currently the knob derives most
of it's colours from the gtk theme. but this leads to unsatisfactory
results in many cases.	so in the purest sense, native appearance
doesn't work too well. thus, i've not spent too much time on making
it look pretty (which it ain't) design can come later via a reworked
drawing algo or svg background or what ever monstrous hybrid we
cook up :P

obligatory shottage:

Knob Implementation:
-------------------

the knob uses a user definable GtkAdjustment, scales proportionally
down to a point after which only the geometry scales (this is because
thin cairo curves look skanky), has a definable indicator colour
and you can set the number of gauge divisions (often called ticks)

(i noticed that phat knob has an internal and an external adjustment.
what's that for?)

i want to add a pan style option. i also want to figure out the proper
name for the pan style option :P 

currently all the drawing is repeated on every expose. i've added
support for backing store (which i use and is very nice) which
cuts down incidental expose events to almost zero but i'm going to
try and implement some sort of layered cache. probably a static
background and a static foreground with the active middle layer
drawn on every expose (this should reduce much of the drawing to
an acceptable level but i'll profile it to be sure it's actually
faster as i'd still need to render the top layer onto the bottom, 
with alpha)

interestingly, this opens up the possibility of loading static
svg files as either a fg or bg. (these can even be gtk theme specified
although that probably won't be used much in the long run)

it might be worth implementing an api so that the drawing operation
could be handled by a callback (perhaps even a plugin) that way, people
could
use the same knob but use custom drawing code. not sure about the worth
of that either though.

uhm..

that
wraps
it
up.

cheers 
pete.

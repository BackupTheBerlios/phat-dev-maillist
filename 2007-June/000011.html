</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i'd like to propose that we replace the static pixbuf animations in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; phat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pixmap knob with dynamically assigned animation gobjects.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gobject refcounting takes a care of cleanup so sharing animations
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between widgets is trivial. also, by adding some animation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specific information (number of frames being the most important)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the gobject, it serves as a generic animation suitable for use in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different widgets. (mod wheels,  waveform selectors as well as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; knobs for example).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i could also implement a kind of animation store where by you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; load animations into the library with a string tag. then you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can access them via that tag later. (no need to maintain pointers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to animations in your application)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if an animation is selected that does not exist, a default would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; returned to prevent exploding apps or the requirement of tedious error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checking and handling.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the default would only be loaded on demand so as not to waste
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the object could also be used to trigger animation changes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you'd trigger a &quot;change-animation&quot; signal on the object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and any widget connected to that signal would deref it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and load the new one (specified in the signal closure)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this avoids the need to iterate over lists of widgets if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ever want to change animations en masse.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pete.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This stuff sounds good, i'm wondering about a use case for some of it
</I>&gt;<i> though. Is it only for the knobs or for Oscillator selectors and stuff
</I>&gt;<i> like that? Would animation changes only be from changing a &quot;theme&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> something else?
</I>
the animation object would be useful in anything that needs an
animation.

rendered widgets: sliders, knobs, leds, mod wheels, possibly even
keyboards, waveform selectors, all would have a common source. by
subclassing gdkpixbuf, you
still have access to all the lower level functions by casting it to a
gdkpixbuf.

(that's all it is really. a gdkpixbuf with some additional variables and
available functions)

the widget knows what it wants to do with that sequence of frames so you
don't
need any widget specific information in the object itself. 

changing the animation would be done on a per application basis not
globally.
i don't envisage any themes shipping phat animations any time soon so
there's
no point. you have two situations. firstly, you could write an app that
is skinnable
and have an easy way to change the skin, secondly, you have a mostly
native
application with pixmap phat knobs. if the app author provides for it,
the user
could select their preferred animation (or say a high visibility
animation if they are
visually impaired).

it wouldn't take much code to implement the &quot;change-animation&quot; signal
and you
can ignore completely it if you don't use it.

pete.

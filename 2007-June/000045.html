Hi,

I've just been looking over Reason and a few other apps to get an idea
of the requirements for knobs. Not all of these are essential, but I
think most of them are. Anyway, I hope it's useful:


Use Cases
  o Continuous knob - selection of a value from a range of values.
    e.g. Volume, Treble, Bass, Panning, Pitch, Attack. 
  o Discrete knob - selection of one particular value from several.
    e.g. Resolution - 1/2, 1/4. 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64.
    (I've seen one knob with 9 discrete positions. That is probably
    about the most needed.)


Display
  o Various styles, colors and sizes of knobs.
  o Label underneath knob to describe it, e.g. &quot;Treble&quot;.
    Sometimes this is placed beside the knob, e.g. when a column of
    vertical knobs is used, or when knobs are crammed together in the
    mixer. Also occasionally it has a box around it.
  o Labels for ends of range for continuous knobs, e.g. &quot;-&quot; and &quot;+&quot;.
  o Labels for each discrete position, e.g. &quot;1/2&quot;, &quot;1/4&quot;, &quot;1/8&quot;.
    This also has a line pointing to the position on the knob.
  o Some knobs have an LED at the top to indicate that they are set
    to something other than the central position.
  o Some knobs are highlighted with a colored rectangle to indicate
    that they are controlled by automation.
  o Knobs should also indicate if they have the keyboard focus.
  o Tooltips optionally show the value of the knob when the mouse
    is over the knob and as the value is changed.


Interaction
  o Linear or radial option for moving knob.
  o For the linear style there could be a mouse range option, and
    modifier keys could be pressed to allow more sensitive control.
  o For continuous knobs there may be a detent in the middle.
    (Has anyone seen a continuous knob with several detents?)
  o For discrete knobs the labels could highlight when the mouse
    moves over them and be clicked to select them.
  o Keyboard control - should take keyboard focus and allow the knob
    value to be changed by the keyboard, e.g. Up, Down, Page Up,
    Page Down, Shift+Up, Shift+Down (for finer control).


Accessibility
  o The normal ATK accessibility functions should be used to describe
    the knobs, and also possibly to describe the discrete positions.
  o Although using different colors &amp; styles for knobs is nice, it
    should be possible to switch all knobs to support the user's
    accessibility requirements (e.g. use the theme colors as much
    as possible, or use low or high contrast knobs).
  o The small fonts typically used in audio apps may be a problem
    as well. It should probably be possible to support different fonts.



I'm willing to help out with this, or with some of the other widgets.
(I wrote the original Glade GUI designer, so I know GTK+ fairly well!)

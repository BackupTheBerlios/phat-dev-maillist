it still is a problem of phat, because there is only the fanslider in
it. I dont like it either.

&gt;<i> &gt;  o What is PhatPad supposed to be? I don't think it is working for me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    All I get is a black rectangle and a bunch of vertical lines.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Do you need a special input device to try it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> where the knob controls one value via an adjustment, the pad 
</I>&gt;<i> controls 5. these relate to:
</I>&gt;<i> x pos
</I>&gt;<i> y pos
</I>&gt;<i> x tilt
</I>&gt;<i> y tilt
</I>&gt;<i> and pressure
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> presumably this is intended for use with a stylus rather than a mouse.
</I>&gt;<i> what you connect those adjustments to is up to you. great for live
</I>&gt;<i> tweakage
</I>&gt;<i> i reckon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i'm not sure about the lines (loki?) but if you check the terminal
</I>&gt;<i> output
</I>&gt;<i> you can see the x and y position values printed to stdout when you move
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> mouse over the pad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  o Ideas for new widgets (from a quick look at Reason) -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     o Small buttons for things like [M] [S] [&gt;] [SELECT]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       - toggle buttons or radio buttons.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     o LED toggle buttons
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     o Level meters
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     o 2-way/3-way/n-way switches (horizontal or vertical)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     o Pitch bend/modulation wheel 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     o Maybe prettier spinbutton widgets that look like LCD displays.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> there's some overlap there but yeah, most if not all of that is in line

</I>&gt;<i> agree on implementation details and then have the time to implement

</I>
to me these all look like derivatives from a GtkKnob.
just some differnet ode for the behaviour. and different gfx.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think a reasonable goal for Phat would be to reproduce an interface
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like Reason. It wouldn't have to be pixel-perfect, but should have all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same elements in the same positions and look as nice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> personally, i want it for fully pixmapped interfaces, which is roughly
</I>&gt;<i> what you are describing i think. aside from generic defaults, phat isn't
</I>&gt;<i> likely to ship with anything approaching skins though. you'll have to
</I>&gt;<i> procure the gfx and use them with phat. i can envisage a convenience
</I>&gt;<i> library and applications that wrap phat to provide say, a gui builder,
</I>&gt;<i> xml markup based interfaces, maybe some kind of skin handling and
</I>&gt;<i> bindings to things like osc, lv2 or dssi etc, but thats much more high
</I>&gt;<i> level.
</I>
i am currently trying to break this stuff down to NOT being highlevel.
(or rather being implemented already)

gui-builder and xml markup should be done using (lib)glade.
by encapsulating everything into gobject properties, most stuff should
be accessible from glade.

i am making (slow) progress on this. I started porting the GtkKnob from
gAlan to gob. (it already compiles) need a test harness, to see whether
the port works.

i derived this thing from GtkRange, which I consider a mistake now.
However this can be fixed quite easily now. 

Most of the work was porting to gob:

<A HREF="http://www.5z.com/jirka/gob.html">http://www.5z.com/jirka/gob.html</A>
gob just rocks.


the thing i am trying to do now is finding the best model ( GtkTreeModel
? ) which can represent a synth.
For a first try a GtkTreeModel filled with GtkAdjustments could do.
But i think there should be a single BaseClass for enums and string and
whatnot...

well enough for now...



&gt;<i> if you shove all that into phat then many devs who could potentially
</I>&gt;<i> use it, wouldn't. particularly if they only want the native widgets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for checking out the demos and giving feedback. 
</I>&gt;<i> it really helps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> pete.

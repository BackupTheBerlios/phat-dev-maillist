they are all widgets that could use an animation at least.

the thing is though, in most cases we want a native and a pixmap version
of widgets. this changes the optimal inheritance path imho.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think a reasonable goal for Phat would be to reproduce an interface
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; like Reason. It wouldn't have to be pixel-perfect, but should have all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the same elements in the same positions and look as nice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; personally, i want it for fully pixmapped interfaces, which is roughly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what you are describing i think. aside from generic defaults, phat isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likely to ship with anything approaching skins though. you'll have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; procure the gfx and use them with phat. i can envisage a convenience
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; library and applications that wrap phat to provide say, a gui builder,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; xml markup based interfaces, maybe some kind of skin handling and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bindings to things like osc, lv2 or dssi etc, but thats much more high
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; level.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i am currently trying to break this stuff down to NOT being highlevel.
</I>&gt;<i> (or rather being implemented already)
</I>
this needs a dedicated thread really. just what is the scope of phat.

&gt;<i> gui-builder and xml markup should be done using (lib)glade.
</I>&gt;<i> by encapsulating everything into gobject properties, most stuff should
</I>&gt;<i> be accessible from glade.
</I>
i'd already done this for the erstwhile liblaw and loki gave me the go ahead
to add glade 3 support to phat now that i've ditched liblaw to work on phat. 
i'm not as convinced as you seem to be that this is the optimum way to
construct pixmapped interfaces but people will have the option to do so.
i like glade and would cheerfully be proven wrong. 

&gt;<i> i am making (slow) progress on this. I started porting the GtkKnob from
</I>&gt;<i> gAlan to gob. (it already compiles) need a test harness, to see whether
</I>&gt;<i> the port works.
</I>
i used glade 3 for this. the knob widget doesn't really need support code
(or not much of it) so it was just a matter of writing a catalog file and dropping
the lib with the knob in it into the glade 3 modules dir.  
it's not galan specific though.

you and me both. i signed up with a forwarding address like a muppet
and then wondered why i couldn't post to the list. 
embarrassingly enough, it's about the fourth time i've done that in
recent years. bits of my brain not connected obviously.

Aye. the less duplication the better.

hmm, threads and SDL. i wouldn't be surprised to discover that 
steve chose not to implement those in gtk for a reason. 
still, i'll take a look. i'll have a peek at what ardour does there too.

&gt;<i>  Also an adsr widget would be
</I>&gt;<i> nice and pretty easy. 
</I>
seconded. 

&gt;<i> There are a bunch of other ones we already have
</I>&gt;<i> a few designs for which would be nice too, like the oscillator
</I>&gt;<i> selector (pie menu) widget.
</I>
it's a bit specialised. how about as the default presentation for a
general waveform selector. the options (popup list, no popup or
pie chart) being gobject properties?

&gt;<i>   Do we want to make a todo / wishlist on a
</I>&gt;<i> wiki?
</I>
great idea. it'd be nice if we could have a section per proposed (or
existing) widget with suggestions. eg: should it be a linear adsr only?
or part of a dynamic envelope widget.
if we do set up a wiki, i'd still encourage people to post to the list 
when they make significant edits. 

cheers,
pete.

iirc, this is a problem with shaped X windows and not phat. 
i don't think that there is a comprehensive solution atm.

&gt;<i>    When space is really tight I think I prefer the sliders in Cubase
</I>&gt;<i>    that popup a large slider widget when you click on them.
</I>
when space is tight, i throw a few people out of the window so i can
stretch out. i got an A in defenestration at school.

&gt;<i>  o What is PhatPad supposed to be? I don't think it is working for me.
</I>&gt;<i>    All I get is a black rectangle and a bunch of vertical lines.
</I>&gt;<i>    Do you need a special input device to try it?
</I>
where the knob controls one value via an adjustment, the pad 
controls 5. these relate to:
x pos
y pos
x tilt
y tilt
and pressure

presumably this is intended for use with a stylus rather than a mouse.
what you connect those adjustments to is up to you. great for live
tweakage
i reckon.

i'm not sure about the lines (loki?) but if you check the terminal
output
you can see the x and y position values printed to stdout when you move
the
mouse over the pad.

&gt;<i>  o Ideas for new widgets (from a quick look at Reason) -
</I>&gt;<i>     o Small buttons for things like [M] [S] [&gt;] [SELECT]
</I>&gt;<i>       - toggle buttons or radio buttons.
</I>&gt;<i>     o LED toggle buttons
</I>&gt;<i>     o Level meters
</I>&gt;<i>     o 2-way/3-way/n-way switches (horizontal or vertical)
</I>&gt;<i>     o Pitch bend/modulation wheel 
</I>&gt;<i>     o Maybe prettier spinbutton widgets that look like LCD displays.
</I>
there's some overlap there but yeah, most if not all of that is in line
for possible implementation. I say possible because we need to
agree on implementation details and then have the time to implement
them. neither are guaranteed.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think a reasonable goal for Phat would be to reproduce an interface
</I>&gt;<i> like Reason. It wouldn't have to be pixel-perfect, but should have all
</I>&gt;<i> the same elements in the same positions and look as nice.
</I>
personally, i want it for fully pixmapped interfaces, which is roughly
what you are describing i think. aside from generic defaults, phat isn't
likely to ship with anything approaching skins though. you'll have to
procure the gfx and use them with phat. i can envisage a convenience
library and applications that wrap phat to provide say, a gui builder,
xml markup based interfaces, maybe some kind of skin handling and
bindings to things like osc, lv2 or dssi etc, but thats much more high
level.
if you shove all that into phat then many devs who could potentially
use it, wouldn't. particularly if they only want the native widgets.

thanks for checking out the demos and giving feedback. 
it really helps.

cheers,
pete.

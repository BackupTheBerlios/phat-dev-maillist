</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've just tried some of the demos and here's some initial thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  o PhatFanSlider flickers horribly and isn't that easy to use.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    (The demo is a bit odd as well since the range bar is so long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    you don't really need a fan slider for it.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; iirc, this is a problem with shaped X windows and not phat.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i don't think that there is a comprehensive solution atm.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it still is a problem of phat, because there is only the fanslider in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it. I dont like it either.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; before i reply fully,  can i ask you if you are open to using (or even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; working on) phat if it meets your needs?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not that your input isn't valuable even if not but i could do with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; knowing that from the outset.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; also, are you working towards a competing library or just re
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; working galan's interface?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i dont like competing libraries. (i only dont like the fanslider)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but with some small efforts it would just be a config option to have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; normal slider in place.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we just need a common SliderBaseClass and some sort of factory....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; phat is THE gtk+ audio widgets library.
</I>&gt;<i> Thorsten's sliders that are used in ardour should also be in phat.
</I>&gt;<i> That's on the todo list. As is fixing the fansliders. The code is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty hairy though. Goto's and fun stuff. Also i don't know much
</I>&gt;<i> about xshape etc. We could do it with the xcomposite extension though.
</I>&gt;<i> Would solve the flickering problem. Also, i've got another work around
</I>&gt;<i> for the flickering prob that i'll try sometime soon. Have the xshape
</I>&gt;<i> be the size of the whole screen and just change the mask so the actual
</I>&gt;<i> size of the window doesn't change. Should work i think. Need some of
</I>&gt;<i> your graphics smarts on this stuff though guys.
</I>
Just chiming in again with another &quot;me too&quot; regarding fixing the
ugliness of the fansliders. If we can't get it to look pretty I'm almost
inclined to not use them in specimen anymore. I like the concept, but it
just doesn't look good right now.

Also, I've had a number of people suggest that it would be good to have
them translucent so they don't obscure the gui bits over which they fan
out. Functionally it doesn't matter, but I think it sort of makes users
uncomfortable having this jagged opaque thing cover up other things.

</I>
ok this is very useful as the tab switching wasn't aided by backing
store
(either because the page is unmapped when deactivated or because
a resize is queued when remapped. not sure which)
however, on my laptop, there is still a significant improvement in
redraw rates with backing store enabled. so i'm still in favour
as even if your system is fast enough so that you don't really notice,
the amount of spare cpu cycles available for audio processing
inevitably 
takes a hit when the window is occluded, tabs are switched or the window
is raised from being minimised.

i'll see about profiling it though. see if we can quantify the
improvement
for a given system. 

&gt;<i> I also noticed that the knob code is using a new GdkPixbuf for each
</I>&gt;<i> knob. It should create one and share it for the whole class. That may
</I>&gt;<i> help a little.
</I>
which version is that? recent versions of phasex saw the the animation
abstracted.
one animation is loaded globally and a reference is passed to each knob.

&gt;<i> Maybe with a bit more optimization it will be OK without resorting to
</I>&gt;<i> unusual stuff like backing store. (I can't quite understand why it is so
</I>&gt;<i> slow at present. Someone should try running it under sysprof to see what
</I>&gt;<i> it is doing.)
</I>
my guess would be a combination of resizing (size negotiation), pango
(there's a lot of text on each page and pango is a cpu sponge) and
rendering each knob with
alpha. a sizable chunk of processing that is avoided by backing store.

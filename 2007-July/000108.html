i'd be happy to have this right down the line but it may be impractical
in some cases. consider that you prefer sliders to knobs, the layout
would change enormously. mandating this for all applicable widgets
will lead to some pretty severe design constraints being
placed on client applications.

still, we will cross that bridge when we get to it.

</I>
to be honest, this is slightly beside the point. clearly, among the
current
phat devs, we have a collection of different opinions, some of which 
contradict each other.  and this is just a microcosm of the wider world
of devs and (even more so) end users. that we provide good defaults is
not controversial. what those defaults should be and how we arrive at
that decision is the real question. 

&gt;<i> I wouldn't trust in packagers making the right decisions, but you 
</I>&gt;<i> can't keep them from changing whatever they like, anyway.
</I>
i don't like this assumption that there is a universal &quot;right&quot; way to 
do anything. mainly because we are not dealing with absolutes but
also because it demands conflict when you disagree with someone.

pete.

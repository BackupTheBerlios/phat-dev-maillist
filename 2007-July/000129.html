good idea. there's still some superfluous junk in there but you
can't have everything and i think it's a better bet than GtkWidget on
balance.

&gt;<i> however for the PhatKnob and PhatFanSliders we need to provide backwards compatibility.
</I>
we discussed this recently and the consensus seemed to be that 
it'd be better to rip up the API and bump the library version.
loki is the only known user of PhatKnob and i'll happily update anyone's
code to suit a changed PhatFanSlider. (probably only specimen?)
normally this kind of thing is a big taboo but you'll rarely get 
a better set of mitigating circumstances than these.

&gt;<i> but all other new widgets could be derived from GtkRange and we would
</I>&gt;<i> have a common base class.
</I>
gets my vote. i think we could still do with additional abstract classes
for code common to say, all sliders or all knobs. we can evolve that
as we go though. it's pretty easy to change things around up until
we the time we release.

&gt;<i> it would also be nice to have the widget window removed from the knob
</I>&gt;<i> and use the parents window. i would go for this...
</I>
what are the benefits / drawbacks of doing so?
i assume we still need a window (event box?) for mouse updates, tooltips
and the like
and tricks like backing store would no longer be applicable..

pete.

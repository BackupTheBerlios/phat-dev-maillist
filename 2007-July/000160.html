i've just written and scrapped about 800 words that can be
summed up as followed.

i think it's a bad idea now.

basically, how would we describe something like that in the
abstract? either we don't and make them static (hardcoded)
hybrid widgets or we do and we require some kind of markup 
language or other configuration file.
it's not like you can just set a pixmap property and be done.
pixmaps don't scale well anyway so you immediately introduce
restrictions by allowing them in conjunction with vector stuff.

i've got other ideas and i'll try to detail them along with some
background of the general problems we face (just for reference,
not because they aren't obvious) but i think that we should
concentrate on getting the widgets we want into svn, fixing them
up, reorganising the class structure to minimise duplication
(but don't get overzealous about it, it's not the end
of the world if the lib is a few hundred KB larger)
and then look to doing a release.

if a compelling solution comes up in the mean time and everyone
gets on board with it then fine, but otherwise it might be a
good idea to think about attempting more complex but flexible
solutions further down the line. (perhaps an unstable branch
when phat is stabilised again)

any thoughts?

pete.

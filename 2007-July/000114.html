</I>
ok. this requires default graphics though, it also requires a uniform 
interface for the slider as a whole. (expecting client applications
to monitor the type of slider in use and switch interfaces to adapt
is not a good idea imo) this leads to one of two possibilities.

1. a limited set of common options
2. an unlimited option set with redundant options in some cases. 
(you can't set a slider animation or pixmap on a native slider or set
the
number of ticks on an animated knob)

another problem is that say i design a nice pixmap interface to look
like my favourite piece of dodgy 80's hardware. if i can't override
the global defaults and a user switched to native knob types, my
interface
suddenly looks like ass. i guess this is fixed by providing just such an
override. of course that override is then open to abuse. (where abuse
means what ever to whoever)

really, i think that the pixmap / native dichotomy is pretty well
entrenched.
trying to reconcile the differences in one system is possible but might
require such tortuous contingencies as to be more trouble than it's
worth.

i'd prefer that you can switch between control &quot;presentations&quot; or have 
presentations represented by options to a common base. eg slider
is the base and have optional input methods to control it and optional
extensions like the fan or a popup of some sort. or for another example
the knob is the base but you can switch between the knob and the 
notknob (thorwils creation, if you're not familiar) presentation.

this is a much easier proposition. still, if people are in favour of
a broader set of interchangeable options (including pixmap/native)
then i'll go with that, albeit reluctantly.

&gt;<i> Now on the part about giving reasonable default to widgets... I guess
</I>&gt;<i> it will be impossible to make everyone happy. But as long as a change

</I>
pedantically speaking, change is possible anyway. &quot;use the source luke&quot;
but that's not really a viable option for most. so i agree with you
provided that change is both possible and practical.

i also think that we should listen to feedback and periodically
consider the how the defaults have been received with a mind
to best serving the needs of devs and users.

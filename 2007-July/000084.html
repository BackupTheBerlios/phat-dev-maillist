<PRE>backing store:

i've just been working on a patch to phasex that 
enables backing store. this limits expose events
to those triggered by resizing or application directed
updates. (well, nearly)

phasex has almost 100 knob widgets and hundreds
of native gtk widgets optionally spread over two
pages. as a result, the time it takes to redraw occluded
areas or when maximising from a minimised state
can be significant. apart from the cost of redrawing
everything, it looks damned ugly as all the widgets
slowly reassemble themselves on screen. bar some 
kind of 2D acceleration, this seems to be the only
way to mitigate the problem.

to make use of it you are required to enable backing store
(and that means editing your X conf) and trades
increased memory usage for a lighter CPU load.
is anyone interested in seeing this available in phat?

charset animation:

i just thought of another use for the animation object.
rendered text characters could be stored in an animation
with frames representing letters of the alphabet and
other characters.

pre rendered text is almost certainly faster than pango
antialiased text, avoids the alignment problems
associated with static pixmap interfaces and dynamic
text, opens the way for some degree of internationalised
eye candy and looks better. all we'd need is a text
widget to render strings based on a given animation
object.

pete.

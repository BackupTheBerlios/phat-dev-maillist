</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What are we doing about themes? I've changed the drawing code in the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it's not themed sensitive at all at the moment. Anyone know about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; themes and cairo? Is there a way to get gdkgc or styles as cairo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; context stuff? I'm not sure about what we should do with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; plugin/switch expose handler stuff but I guess working cairo theme
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; support might be a first step.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's pretty easy to use gtk style colours:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gdk_cairo_set_source_color (cr,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &amp;widget-&gt;style-&gt;light[GTK_STATE_NORMAL]);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but making nice looking stuff that works well on all themes with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only the colours found in the theme isn't so easy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in particular, the themes normally do the drawing (in many cases)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and so impart their own look on what is drawn. we bypass that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with cairo and i'm not sure if an alternative exists yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still, colours we can do, no problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pete.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, as i said, gtkgc and styles. So should we be sensitive to line
</I>&gt;<i> width etc? Or just ignore some of that?
</I>
didn't know before, still don't now. anyone else?

are the line width, line style et al ever used in 
practise when drawing widgets?

the thing is, even if we intercept them, we can't
replicate the actual theme drawing methods which
are not exposed in any uniform way (if at all).
not to mention the funky hacks that many themes employ.

my hunch is that it's a waste of time. if anyone
knows differently then i'll happily print out and
eat my hunch. 

one thing to consider though, much of the
distinctiveness of any given theme comes from
the line styles and depth cues (highlights
and shadows) this begs the question, why do we
need to use cairo for straight edges anyway?
why not just defer to the gdk funcs that
hook the theme engines in those cases?

i'm not aware of any themes that do anything
special with the arc or arbitrary lines anyway
so by using cairo in only those instances
where there are tangible benefits to doing so,
we probably don't lose anything.

rambling on.. what we could do is add theme
properties to the widgets, respect those in
the drawing code then at least themers
can leverage some degree control over the
appearance of phat stuff. albeit belatedly.

whether they would add contingencies for non
standard widgets is another matter.

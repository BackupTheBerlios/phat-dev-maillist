Because of the fake hardware aspect and because having more sources 
of inspirtaion is better than having less :)

I'm all for using metaphors and giving a sense of &quot;touchability&quot; and 
weight, but only where it can be done without imposing unecessary 
restrictions. I'm opposed to rule out more abstract UI elements.

I must puke if I see pseudo LC displays (simulating a lower 
resolution, less readable characters and often bad contrast) and 
gigantic type labels FOOSYNTH 2000 (wasting space and being 
distracting).

</I>
Menus and comboboxes hardly have real counterparts either and virtually 
noone complains.

I know we disagree on the worth of real-worldness and on the right balance 
between choice and making decisions for the user, so lets not pull all that 
up again as it leads nowhere.


&gt;<i> if so, then nobody gets locked into one type or the other and you can

</I>
The original mail I replied to came very close to opposition to its 
existence.

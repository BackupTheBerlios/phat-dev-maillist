there are benefits to having independent packages:

the build system for each is simple,

it's obvious to package maintainers that these are
independent projects with separate dependencies

releases can be independent too. (eg, fixing an important bug
in pyphat wouldn't require a new phat release.)

it's also more obvious when a package has failed to build.

an incorporated setup is easier for end users to
download and build but that's about it. on the down
side, we risk package maintainers just making one
package with all the dependencies thrown in. this
might even cause phat not to be included in distros
at all if the dependencies are too far out or unstable.
(this is only a factor if vanilla phat is used anywhere
without the extra packages. if practically all client
software requires say, the lv2 lib, then it nothing
was gained in that by separating it.)

we might also get people bugging us on the lists saying
&quot;i built phat.. now where the hell are the python bindings!?!&quot;
because they missed the message saying that they
weren't built for what ever reason. this wouldn't
happen with separate packages as each would only
built if it's requisite dependencies were met.

if there are other reasons for an incorporated setup,
please bring them up. i only prefer independent packages
because after thinking about it, they seem to give
us the most flexibility.

I agree that the discrete knob may not be the best choice
usability-wise. But quite a few audio apps like to use an interface very
similar to a real piece of equipment so it can be useful there.

</I>
I'd like to see a list of requirements for all the widgets we want in
Phat. I just posted the knob list as that was the first one I did. (I've
also looked at sliders, buttons and switches and could post those lists
later.)

Maybe you could do the env / adsr requirements, as I don't really know
what is needed there. Are there any good examples anywhere?

Most of the widgets needed for Phat are pretty easy to write. If we can
agree on requirements then someone can volunteer for each widget and go
off and write it in a fairly short time. We only need to do a few
widgets each.


&gt;<i>  Also metering widgets would be very nice.
</I>&gt;<i> Porting all the meters from meterbridge to phat would allow all the
</I>&gt;<i> apps that create dodgy dpm meters to either use one that's already
</I>&gt;<i> coded or one of the very cool looking ppm meters. ;)
</I>
OK. I'll have a go at that. Though they seem closely tied to JACK at the
moment - I suppose we want to remove that dependency.


&gt;<i> Porting Thorsten's ardour slider to phat is also higher on the todo i
</I>&gt;<i> think.
</I>
I could have a look at that as well, if Thorsten is busy. Where is the
code in ardour?

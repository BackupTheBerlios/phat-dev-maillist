<PRE>the basic port to phat of GtkRange is in.
it builds without errors here but i've not tested
it in use. (kinda tricky with an abstract type :)


i put some notes in the top of the c file which are as follows:

--
i've implemented the intl marcos as simple pass throughs. (P_ and I_)
this is because we don't use intl at the moment. although we probably
should now that property information is visible in glade. if we add
intl at a later date, we only need to delete the macro definitions
below and it should work
i replaced GTK_PARAM_READWRITE and GTK_PARAM_READABLE with G_*
but they aren't equivalent. the G*_STATIC_* variants included in
the GTK_* definitions in gtkprivate.h require gobject &gt;= 2.8 so
we'd need to check for that to use them. which is probably what i'll do

the &quot;change_value&quot; signal registration is commented out as it requires
custom marshallers. we may not need it anyway but this serves as a
reminder to either add glib-genmarshal etc to the build system order
remove that signal.

we need to sort out the credits above too. 
--

i'd not noticed the &quot;change_value&quot; signal before. it's interesting
because
it provids a way to implement the mapping object on top of GtkRange.
(the signal is emitted before the adj value is changed and you can
interject with your own value and halt further processing by returning 
TRUE) 
still, it's probably a good idea to go ahead with PhatRange anyway.

in particular, we don't really need all the scrollbar stuff that is
littered throughout GtkRange. 

pete.

unless you read documentation. i'm all in favour of intuitive methods

the fanslider has no counterpart in reality. this makes it literally
counter
intuitive regardless of how effectively it solves the problems it was
designed for.

many people, myself included will be disinclined to use it for simple
reasons of comfort and familiarity. you can resent that all you like but
it is nevertheless a factor.
it's also true that the dual axis control makes it harder to modulate
consistently with the mouse, and while you can lock the axis with
key mods (iirc), as you said above, &quot;That's not exactly discoverable.&quot;
i hate being required to do so anyway. (i'd rather dual axis
mode be secondary, for precision editing). but that's just me.

on the bright side, it might be possible to seamlessly switch between
fansliders and other slider varieties via global phat settings (for the
native widgets at least).

if so, then nobody gets locked into one type or the other and you can
evangelise the benefits of the fanslider without fear of developer
prejudice. at least, please don't mistake disinterest in the fanslider,
for opposition to it's existence.

pete.

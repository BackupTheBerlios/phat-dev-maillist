</I>
very true. but looking at it another way, we have a &quot;possible solution
vs no solution&quot; situation. bar any unforeseen problems (which
should be negated by making it a run time option) it should make
the user experience much better and improve performance,
particularly when using large interfaces and or complex interfaces.

notes about enabling backing store could be included with phat
and we could encourage developers of client applications to
do the same. dedicated audio distros may be open to shipping
with backing store enabled by default. can't hurt to ask anyway.

&gt;<i> How does it relate to compositing?
</I>
as far as my limited knowledge of compositing stretches, there's
no relation. the X server is simply instructed to keep a copy
of the window contents and to update it itself
rather than ask the toolkit to redraw the window via an 
expose event. (hence the additional memory)

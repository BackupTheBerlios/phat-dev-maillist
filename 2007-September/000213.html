it just calls mouse_update_mouse with a different flag, and i dont
understand what it does really ;)

lets try to break all this behaviour down to:

gdouble get_new_value( gdouble button_press_x, gdouble button_press_y
                       gdouble current_x,      gdouble current_y      );


this function would return a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which is then
scaled by the widget code and fed into the adjustment.

we still need some extra parameters (like widget size and such)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  i talked with thorwil about knobs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in particular and i saw his try for this in his blog too and he said
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; we have serious discrepancies about knobs ui user use. we should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; document them and take a plan to handle them. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i think this is already resolved (in as much as it can be)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the configurable input mapping should allow people to choose 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their preferred method. this is a deal breaker for me so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it's not resolved then we have problems. if you have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more to add then we should run it past loki again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> allow people to choose - i agree (see below), but the point is that we
</I>&gt;<i> need behaviours to choose from defined. Do you agree with definitions
</I>&gt;<i> posted in thorwil blog? Or we have them documented elsewere?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Now how this interacts with phatrange? In my vision so far direct access
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; methods should be implemented as proxy code to phatrange and not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; directly interacting with widget code and thus it may be possible to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; some hairy macro to define them in all widgets. we need this because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; gobject model does not support method inheritance, or i am wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i'm not sure. we can chain up to access virtual parent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functions?. (cast the object to it's parent type)
</I>
yup. inheritance is possible with virtual methods. And chaining back to
them.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> so this needs more investigation, i'm concerned for pyphat in particular
</I>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; All gtkadjustment-less methods are implemented in phatrange by operating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on gtkadjustment referenced in it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm still thinking about what is best way for interoperation between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; gtkadjustment and mapper object. in particular, mapper, at least one i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have currently (monothonic linear spline), has valid range and is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; somewhat incompatible with change of it, caused by external
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; gtkadjustment. Do you think we need to support external gtkadjustments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; when we have mapper? I'd say no. Logarithm also has input restritions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; too, thus rendering -50..0 gtkadjustment unusable. At least directly,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but i think mapper should operate on real range not artificial one, like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (0..1).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are there any cases where we cannot detect and translate 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problematic ranges? if there are or the detection and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; translation is too expensive then we are a bit screwed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can detect but i doubt we can translate. So we can reject external
</I>&gt;<i> adjustment if it does not apply, but then, why someone would want
</I>&gt;<i> external adjustment at all?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; After more inspection of phatknob and those concept discrepancies we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have, i now beleive we should come with configuration system in next
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; release. I propose (and have motivation to work on) class code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; interacting with gconf. In particular I want to start with radial/linear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; knob behaviour, always with left mouse button.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this should be configurable. it's the only way we can accommodate 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different user and developer preferences. (IOW, it's the only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way we can prevent me and thorsten from killing each other :P )
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i'd like to see targets (linear control, absolute control, menu popup
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc) be mappable to input combinations (buttons 1 - 5, and modifiers)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; More configuration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; candidates are welcome. Lets collect them in this thread, I'll put them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on wiki once we have plan.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should have manual value input configurable too:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far list of things that need to be configurable are:
</I>&gt;<i>  * context menu popup
</I>&gt;<i>  * linear control
</I>&gt;<i>  * radial control
</I>&gt;<i>  * absolute control
</I>&gt;<i>  * manual input (edit box to entr value with keyboard)
</I>
how about being able to set the step size ?
like 10% per pixel on left and 1% per pixel on right ?

i am not convinced that gconf is the right way.
we should try to use the gtkrc system for this.
it would give us per Widget control including wildcards:

*.LFO.f step = 10
*.LFO.* step = 20

* step = 100

(the syntax is not right but you get the idea... :)

however i dont know whether the gtkrc system allows for modifiers to be
configured. perhaps we would need to write our own parser or use xml.

i already wrote a parser with GScanner and this is quite nice tool.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> each mappable to mouse buttons 1-5 with modifiers (including double
</I>&gt;<i> click as option). mappings are optional i.e. if not configured they
</I>&gt;<i> are not available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mappings should be overridable by program (developer) using the widget.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm somewhat sceptical someone will want more than one method of mouse
</I>&gt;<i> control active. So maybe it is better to have mouse drag mappable to
</I>&gt;<i> button and have mouse drag behaviour as additional property.
</I>
i use both linear and radial on left and right mouse button very
much in galan. linear for fine tuning and radial for fast parameter
changes.
